# Customer Churn Predicton in Banking Industry

There is a critical issue where customers always switch banks due to various reasons like dissatisfaction, better offers or even due to change in their financial situations. Due to this, banks suffer financial losses because getting new customers is more costly than retaining the existing clients. This project aims at predicting whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling the bank to take proactive steps to retain them.

Using machine learning models, this project identifies factors leading to customer churn, giving banks the chance to allocate resources for customer retention.

## Aim and Scope

The aim of this project is come up with a predictive model that can forecast customer churn accurately in the banking sector. The model analyzing customer data collected from Kaggle.com (product usage, age, account activity) to identify key reasons for churn.

The scope includes:
1. Collecting and preparing a dataset from Kaggle.
2. Analyzing and preprocessing the data for analysis.
3. Build and train two machine learning models for churn prediction (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier).
4. Evaluating and optimizing the best performing model for better accuracy.
5. Provide insights and recommendations on how banks can reduce customer churn.
